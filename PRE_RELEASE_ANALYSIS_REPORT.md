## Issues Identified

### 1. Dependency Configuration Issues ⚠️

**Priority: Medium**

In `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
dependencies = [
    "black>=25.0,<26.0.0",           # Should be dev dependency
    "poetry-core (>=2.0.0,<3.0.0)", # Should not be runtime dependency
]
```

**Impact:** Unnecessary runtime dependencies increase package size and potential security surface.

**Recommendation:** Move `black` to dev dependencies and remove `poetry-core` from runtime dependencies.

### 2. Code Quality Issues ⚠️

**Priority: Low**

1. **String Formatting Bug** in `moduli_generator/__init__.py:353`:
   ```python
   self.logger.info('Screened {len(screening_futures)} candidate files for key-lengths:' +
                    f'{self.config.key_lengths}')
   ```
   Missing f-string prefix on first part.

2. **Performance Optimization Opportunity** in `generate_moduli()`:
    - Sequential processing: generates all candidates before screening
    - Could be optimized with pipeline processing

3. **Duplicate Entries** in CHANGELOG.rst:
    - Multiple identical entries reduce changelog clarity

### 3. Minor Documentation Issues ⚠️

**Priority: Low**

- Some docstrings could be more concise
- Changelog formatting inconsistencies
- Comment typo: "COnfigure Logger" in db/__init__.py:366
