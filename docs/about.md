# About Moduli Generator

## What is Moduli Generator?

Moduli Generator is a specialized Python tool designed to generate SSH moduli files for secure communication. SSH moduli
are prime numbers used in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm, which is fundamental to establishing secure SSH
connections.

## Purpose and Importance

SSH moduli play a crucial role in cryptographic security:

- **Key Exchange Security**: They provide the mathematical foundation for secure key exchange between SSH clients and
  servers
- **Forward Secrecy**: Properly generated moduli help ensure that past communications remain secure even if long-term
  keys are compromised
- **Cryptographic Strength**: High-quality moduli are essential for maintaining the security of SSH connections

## Technical Overview

The Moduli Generator provides:

### Core Functionality

- **Moduli Generation**: Creates cryptographically secure prime numbers suitable for SSH use
