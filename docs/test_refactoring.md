# Test Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made to `test_main.py`

The file `test_main.py` was refactored to accommodate changes to file locations within the project structure.
Specifically, the `__main__.py` file was moved from the root of the `moduli_generator` package to the `scripts`
subdirectory.

### Details of Changes:

1. Updated all import patch paths in test functions from:
   ```python
   patch("moduli_generator.__main__.ModuliGenerator")
   ```
   to:
   ```python
   patch("moduli_generator.scripts.__main__.ModuliGenerator")
   ```

2. Updated all other references to the `__main__` module throughout the test file to point to the new location:
   ```python
   # Old path
   "moduli_generator.__main__.argparser_moduli_generator.local_config"
   "moduli_generator.__main__.main"
   "moduli_generator.__main__.exit"
   
   # New path
   "moduli_generator.scripts.__main__.argparser_moduli_generator.local_config"
   "moduli_generator.scripts.__main__.main"
   "moduli_generator.scripts.__main__.exit"
   ```

### Test Verification:

After making these changes, all tests in `test_main.py` now pass successfully. The refactoring ensures that the tests
correctly reference the new file location structure.
